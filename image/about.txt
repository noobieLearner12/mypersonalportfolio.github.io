I am a self-taught Web Developer from Nepal with a working capability in HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript. I am currently amplifying my skill by learning ReactJS and 
server-side programming. 
As a Developer, My aim is to take the step from beginner to professional with a 
company where I can grow, learn and present my skills. 
As a Self-taught Developer I am always keen to learn new 
technology and be updated with modern trends.
